Joe Hart (SYTYF? 3rd Place 2014, Tickled Pig Winner 2014) has a brand new show all about the digital world. Nerd out, explore the internet, get digitised live on stage and just maybe defeat an evil empire. 'Unpretentious, warm and genuinely funny' ★★★★ (MumbleComedy.net). 'A So You Think You're Funny runner-up, Hart is likeable, engaging and yes, I do think he's funny.' (Scotsman).
