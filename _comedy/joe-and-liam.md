Joe and Liam hit up the Brighton Fringe this May! Returning to Lamb Comedy @ Nowhere Man on the 11th to 13th of May.

A double bill from: 
Joe Hart (SYTYF finalist, Tickled Pig winner, as seen on BBC Trending) and Liam Webber (Best New Act nominee, Midlands Comedy Awards).

Tech-savvy gay nerd Joe is a comedic wizard. He brings his musings of modern and ancient life with a video game twist.
“Comedy Gold” (The Scotsman). 

Liam is a high-octane character comedian who’ll whisk you away on a whirlwind of vignettes, sketches, and frankly tenuous leaps of thought destined to leave you laughing/ crying/ astonished/ confused/ all of the above. 
"An extraordinary performer" (The Scotsman).
